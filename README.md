# 🧩  Journal Trading Project  🧩

### 🔵 Context: Daily I make trading, so I wanted to create a interactive chart where I can see my results month by month.

### ⬇️ INSTRUCTIONS ⬇️

###  INPUTS ⬇️
#### There is two inputs, the first contain the quantity of the operation (the capital, when you lose or when you win).
####  - The fisrt value, you put into this input, will be the `Initial Capital Value`.
####  - From the second value, it will be subtracted or added according to the `Initial Capital Value`.
####  - If the value(s) after the `Initial Capital Value` is positive, it will be added, otherweise, if the value is negative, it will be subtracted.
#### The second input, is the "Date input", here you have to put the date with this format --> "DD/MM/YYYY".
#### - If you save a date, you just can save the same date or dates after. Dates before will be ignored and won't appear in the chart or be saved to Local Storage.

### BUTTONS ⬇️
#### "INGRESAR" --> This button will be save the data in the LocalStorage and show it in the Chart.
####  - It will be work, just if there is information in the two inputs (1. Capital, 2. Date), and if the data is in the correct format.
#### "ELIMINAR ANTERIOR" --> It will be delete the `last object` hosted in the Local Storage, and the Chart will also be updated.
#### "BORRAR HISTORIAL" --> It will be clear all the Local Storage and the Chart will be start again.

### HISTORY TABLE ⬇️
#### When you put information in the Chart, it will be appear too in the bottom from the page, in the following structure ⬇️
####                                                              (date: DD/MM/YYY............(Value putted in the input)  
####                                                              |  20/04/2000.................................... $10  |
####                                                              |  21/04/2000.................................... $-1   |
